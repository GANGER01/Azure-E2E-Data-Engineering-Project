This Azure Data Engineering Project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline on Azure to process and visualize customer demographics.
The pipeline extracts data from an on-premises SQL database, transforms it using Azure Data Factory and Databricks, 
and visualizes key metrics like product sales by gender, category, total revenue, and other business KPIs in Power BI.
